function out = SB_BinaryStretch(x,stretchWhat)
% SB_BinaryStretch Characterizes stretches of 0/1 in time-series binarization
%
% (DOESN'T ACTUALLY, see note) measure the longest stretch of consecutive zeros
% or ones in a symbolized time series as a proportion of the time-series length.
%
% The time series is symbolized to a binary string by whether it's above (1) or
% below (0) its mean.
%
%---INPUTS:
%
% x, the input time series
%
% stretchWhat, (i) 'lseq1', measures something related to consecutive 1s
%              (ii) 'lseq0', measures something related to consecutive 0s
%
%---NOTES:
% It doesn't actually measure what it's supposed to measure correctly, due to an
% implementation error, but it's still kind of an interesting operation...!
