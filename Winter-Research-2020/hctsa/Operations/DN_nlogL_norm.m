function nlogL = DN_nlogL_norm(y)
% DN_nlogL_norm     Negative log likelihood of data coming from a Gaussian distribution.
%
% Fits a Gaussian distribution to the data using the normfit function in
% Matlab's Statistics Toolbox and returns the negative log likelihood of the
% data coming from a Gaussian distribution using the normlike function.
%
%---INPUT:
% y, a vector of data

% ** Somehow this just scales with length, regardless of the distribution of y?
