% Original definition (in Table 2 of paper cited above)
% sum -> mean to deal with non-equal time-series lengths
% (now scales properly with length)
f_CE1 = @(x) sqrt(mean(diff(x).^2));

out.CE1 = f_CE1(y);


% Definition corresponding to the line segment example in Fig. 9 of the paper
% cited above (using Pythagoras's theorum):
f_CE2 = @(x) mean(sqrt(1+diff(x).^2));

out.CE2 = f_CE2(y);

% Defined as a proportion of the minimum such value possible for this time series,
% this would be attained from putting close values close; i.e., sorting the time
% series

out.minCE1 = f_CE1(sort(y));
out.minCE2 = f_CE2(sort(y));

out.CE1_norm = out.CE1/out.minCE1;
out.CE2_norm = out.CE2/out.minCE2;


end
