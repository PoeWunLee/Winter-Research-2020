function out = MD_rawHRVmeas(x)
% MD_rawHRVmeas     Heart rate variability (HRV) measures of a time series.
%
% Computes the triangular histogram index and Poincare plot measures to a time
% series assumed to measure sequences of consecutive RR intervals measured in
% milliseconds. Doesn't make much sense for other time series
%
% cf. "Do existing measures of Poincare plot geometry reflect nonlinear
%      features of heart rate variability?"
