function out = SY_LocalGlobal(y,subsetHow,n,randomSeed)
% SY_LocalGlobal  Compares local statistics to global statistics of a time series.
%
%---INPUTS:
% y, the time series to analyze
%
% subsetHow, the local subset of time series to study:
%             (i) 'l': the first n points in a time series,
%             (ii) 'p': an initial proportion of the full time series, n
%             (iii) 'unicg': n evenly-spaced points throughout the time series
%             (iv) 'randcg': n randomly-chosen points from the time series
%                               (chosen with replacement)
%
% n, the parameter for the method specified above
%
% randomSeed, an option for whether (and how) to reset the random seed, for the
% 'randcg' input
%
%---OUTPUTS: the mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range,
% skewness, kurtosis, AC(1), and SampEn(1,0.1).
%
% This is not the most reliable or systematic operation because only a single
% sample is taken from the time series and compared to the full time series.
% A better approach would be to repeat over many local subsets and compare the
% statistics of these local regions to the full time series,
% cf. SY_SpreadRandomLocal
