function iszscored = BF_iszscored(x)
% BF_iszscored  Crude check for whether a data vector is z-scored.
%
% (~eps-close to being) z-scored.
% Used for displaying warning messages for functions that require z-scored inputs.
%
%---INPUT:
% x, the input time series (or any vector)
%
%---OUTPUT:
% iszscored, a logical with the verdict.
