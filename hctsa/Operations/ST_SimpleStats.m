function out = ST_SimpleStats(x,whatStat)
% ST_SimpleStats   Basic statistics about an input time series
%
%---INPUTS:
% x, the input time series
%
% whatStat, the statistic to return:
%          (i) 'zcross': the proportionof zero-crossings of the time series
%                        (z-scored input thus returns mean-crossings)
%          (ii) 'maxima': the proportion of the time series that is a local maximum
%          (iii) 'minima': the proportion of the time series that is a local minimum
%          (iv) 'pmcross': the ratio of the number of times that the (ideally
%                          z-scored) time-series crosses +1 (i.e., 1 standard
%                          deviation above the mean) to the number of times
%                          that it crosses -1 (i.e., 1 standard deviation below
%                          the mean)
%          (v) 'zsczcross': the ratio of zero crossings of raw to detrended
%                           time series where the raw has zero mean
