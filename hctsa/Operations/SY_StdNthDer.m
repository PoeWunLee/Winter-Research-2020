function out = SY_StdNthDer(y,n)
% SY_StdNthDer  Standard deviation of the nth derivative of the time series.
%
% Based on an idea by Vladimir Vassilevsky, a DSP and Mixed Signal Design
% Consultant in a Matlab forum, who stated that You can measure the standard
% deviation of the nth derivative, if you like".
%
% cf. http://www.mathworks.de/matlabcentral/newsreader/view_thread/136539
%
% The derivative is estimated very simply by simply taking successive increments
% of the time series; the process is repeated to obtain higher order
% derivatives.
%
% Note that this idea is popular in the heart-rate variability literature, cf.
% cf. "Do Existing Measures ... ", Brennan et. al. (2001), IEEE Trans Biomed Eng 48(11)
% (and function MD_hrv_classic)
%
%---INPUTS:
%
% y, time series to analyze
%
% n, the order of derivative to analyze
