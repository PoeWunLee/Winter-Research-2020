function out = SC_fastdfa(y)
% SC_fastdfa   Matlab wrapper for Max Little's ML_fastdfa code
%
% Measures the scaling exponent of the time series using a fast implementation
% of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).
%
%---INPUT:
% y, the input time series, is fed straight into the fastdfa script.

% The original fastdfa code is by Max A. Little and publicly-available at
% http://www.maxlittle.net/software/index.php
